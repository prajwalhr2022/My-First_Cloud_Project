# My-First_Cloud_Project
This is a basic project which i have implemented to test my cloud skills and have an hands on experience.

here is the steps on how  i built this project :
1)create an amplify instance and host the site on it.
2)create a lambda function to perform the computation and calculation from the site .Lambda function also updates the Dynamo Db tables.
3)create a React API gateway to connect the lambdafnctin to the amplify instance
4)Create a Dynamo DB table to store the data from the website.
5)Attach IAM Roles to the lambda function to enable it to communicate with the Dynamo DB.
